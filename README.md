# PyPitch: Pitch Detection using Python

## Description
PyPitch is a Python suite of algorithms designed to detect the most prominent frequency in audio chunks. It is particularly useful in audio analysis, music theory, and applications requiring pitch detection.

## Requirements
- numpy~=1.26.3

## Features
PyPitch offers a variety of pitch detection classes:

- **YinPitchDetector**: YIN algorithm implementation.
- **AutoCorrelationPitchDetector**: Autocorrelation-based detection.
- **FFTPitchDetector**: FFT-based detection.
- **HarmonicFFTPitchDetector**: Harmonic-focused FFT detection.

## Usage
The PyPitch library offers various functions for pitch detection. Import the necessary modules from the library and apply them to your audio data. Detailed documentation on usage is provided within the code.
